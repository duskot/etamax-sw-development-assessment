etaMax - Software Development Assessment

In this repository there are the source code of the implementation and executable binary .jar file.
For building this project I used maven and you can find maven pom.xml file here as well.
The project is compiled using Java 11.

Short instructions for running the application:

Please download the file "etaMath-1.0.0.jar" from github repository to local machine. 
Using terminal navigate to the folder you saved the file and use the command "java -jar etaMath-1.0.0.jar" to run the application.

NOTES:

According to the available time I had at my disposal, the task is not completely 
finished in terms of writing detailed tests, documentation comments and 
inline comments for classes, methods and code.

There is also one bug that I didn't managed to solve in the time I had at my disposal. 
The bug refers to the behavior of the application when the time specified for 
the task answer (keyboard input) expires. In that case, the application does not accept 
the next input from the keyboard, than ignores it, and accepts the next input.
